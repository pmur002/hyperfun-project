# hyperfun

This repository contains a (modified) copy of the HyperFun source code
obtained from [https://hyperfun.org/](https://hyperfun.org/).

The code is licensed under the 
[Common Good Public License](http://www.cgpl.org/)

The code (on master branch) has been modified to build and 
run on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04).

The code on `no-glut` branch has the GLUT dependency ripped out
(so the code is self-contained).  Of course, you get no view
of the model - this is only useful to generate STL output (or VRML
or POV or CLI).
